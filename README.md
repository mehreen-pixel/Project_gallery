# Responsive Personal Portfolio Website

This is a fully responsive personal portfolio website created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases an introduction (About Me), a list of technical skills, a project gallery with live/demo links, and a contact form (non-functional). The design is clean, responsive, and includes a dark mode toggle for better user experience.



## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Page structure and content
- **CSS3** – Styling and layout (Flexbox, Grid, custom variables)
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Dark mode toggle and basic interactivity
- **Responsive Design** – Media queries and mobile-first layout


## Features

- **Fully Responsive Layout** (320px and up)
- **Dark Mode Toggle**
- **Smooth Scrolling**
- **Project Gallery** with images, titles, and links
- **Hover effects & animations**
- **Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop views supported**
- **Clean and organized folder structure**


##  Challenges Faced

- **Responsive Layout**: Ensuring the layout didn’t break at small screen sizes (e.g., 320px).
- **Dark Mode Implementation**: Toggling dark mode while keeping consistent color variables.
- **Mobile Optimization**: Balancing font/image scaling, touch targets, and spacing.



##  Future Improvements

- Add working backend for contact form using Node.js or third-party service like Formspree.
- Include animations using AOS or GSAP libraries.
- Deploy the site using GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.
